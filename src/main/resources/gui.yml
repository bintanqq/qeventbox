# QEVENTBOX SHOP GUI CONFIGURATION
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines the layout, items, prices, and commands executed upon purchase
# within the event shop (/eventshop) GUI.
#
# Instructions:
# - Use standard Spigot material names (e.g., DIAMOND, PLAYER_HEAD).
# - Use color codes (& or §).
#
# --- PLAYER HEAD CONFIGURATION ---
# To display a player head or custom icon, you must set 'block: PLAYER_HEAD'.
# - skull-owner: Sets the skull owner dynamically (%player%) or statically (account name).
# - skull-texture: Sets a custom icon using a Base64 Texture String.
#                  (Use ONLY skull-owner OR skull-texture, never both).
# Reference: Find Base64 textures at sites like minecraft-heads.com.
